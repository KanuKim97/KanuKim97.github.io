# KanuKim97 Portfolio Website

This is a modern, responsive portfolio website designed for KanuKim97, an Android Developer.
It features a dark-themed, glassmorphism design with smooth animations.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main structure of the website.
- `style.css`: Custom CSS styles including variables for easy theming and animations.
- `script.js`: JavaScript for smooth scrolling and scroll-triggered animations.

## How to Run Locally

1.  Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  Or, if you have VS Code with the "Live Server" extension, right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

1.  Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `username.github.io` or just `portfolio`).
2.  Push these files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`) to the repository.
3.  Go to the repository **Settings** > **Pages**.
4.  Under **Source**, select `Deploy from a branch`.
5.  Select `main` (or `master`) branch and `/ (root)` folder.
6.  Click **Save**.
7.  Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

## Customization

Since I couldn't automatically extract your resume content, you will need to update `index.html` with your actual details:

- **About Section**: Replace the placeholder text with your bio.
- **Experience**: Update the "Company Name" and description in the timeline.
- **Projects**: Add your actual projects, images, and links.
- **Links**: Update the `href` attributes for your Email, LinkedIn, and GitHub in the Contact section.
